### **Art:**
Chinese opera takes up much of traditional Chinese art and culture. It involves *g?ngfu*, music, song, dance, acrobatics, drama and literary arts, all in one type of performance: Chinese opera.
The coolest thing about Chinese opera is that you can always tell who the bad guy and good guy is, on top of their personalities.

> #### Costuming
> Masks are used in the opera; each color has a different meaning. They are used to portray a character's role and illustrate their emotional state and general character.

> White: sinister, evil, crafty, treacherous, and suspicious. Anyone wearing a white mask is usually the villain. 
> Green: impulsive, violent, no self restraint or self control. 
> Red: brave, loyal. 
> Black: rough, fierce, or impartial.
> Yellow: ambitious, fierce, intelligent
> Blue: steadfast, someone who is loyal and sticks to one side no matter what.
> Pink: happy, funny

### **Festive Food:**
#### Chinese New Year:
Too [many](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#Traditional_food) to name. Niangao (my favorite thing ever), fish, chicken, jiaozi (dumplings), noodles, candy, oranges, Buddhist food, bakkwa, taro cakes, yusheng, turnip cakes- actually I think I just did.

#### Lantern Festival
Only really one. That would be [yuanxiao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangyuan_%28food%29). Yuanxiao is like a bowl of boiling water and the aforementioned niangao in a spherical form stuffed with things. Or this:

Delicious! Interesting fact: the Lantern Festival is basically the Chinese equivalent of Valentine's Day.

#### Dragon Boat Festival
Again, only really one. Which would be [zongzi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongzi), which I have never had so I can't really say what it tastes like but I am assuming from what I've read about it is that it is made of glutinous rice (like yuanxiao and niangao) and filled with different things like the sweet favorite of Chinese fillings [red bean paste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_bean_paste) or meat. 

![zongzipicture](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Zongzi.jpg)

#### Midautumn Festival
***Again***, we only have one food. This is probably the most mixed up festive Chinese food ever, and the most well known. Yup. [Mooncakes!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooncake) Contrary to misinformation in America, these are **not** eaten on Chinese New Year. Instead, they are eaten on the Chinese Moon Festival, or Midautumn Festival. They can be animal shaped, or traditionally shaped like the ones in the picture below.

(Yes, the Chinese have a lot of desserts.)

### **About the Festivals**
#### Chinese New Year
Chinese New Year is celebrated from the first day of the [Chinese Lunar Calendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar) (which by the way varies every single year, it's usually in February though) to the 15th. It basically celebrates good health, harvest, and luck in the coming year. It may also be called the Spring Fesival or the Lunar New Year.

#### Lantern Festival
The Lantern Festival (also called Yuanxiao Festival after the food you eat during it) is a celebration that lands on the 15th day of Chinese New Year celebration. There are lanterns, fireworks, yuanxiao, and riddles.

#### Dragon Boat Festival
The Dragon Boat Festival (also called Duanwu Festival or Double Fifth Festival) is a celebration that lands on the 5th day of the 5th lunar month. You celebrate by eating zongzi and racing dragon boats. It represents the annual peak of masculine energy (the sun is considered masculine) as the sun is usually out the longest on this day.

#### Midautumn Festival
The Midautumn Festival (or Moon Festival) is celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month. This day generally has a full moon on it, hence the mooncakes eaten on the day. It is celebrated by offering fruits and sacrifice to the moon and eating moon cakes while watching the full moon.

#### Chongyang Festival
The Chongyang Festival (or Double Ninth Festival) is celebrated on the 9th day of the 9th lunar month.

### [**The Great Wall of China**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China)
"The Great Wall of China is a 7 km long wall that was built so long ago I have no information to tell you about it."

...is what I would say if I wanted to lie blatantly in front of your face.

The Great Wall of China is *actually* a *3,889 mile* long wall that was built a long time ago and many records were kept over its *200 year* construction.

It was built in many sections from the **Warring States period** to the **end of the Ming era by approximately 800,000 people** in order to defend China from invading tribes.

Originally, Emperor Qin ordered the Great Wall. That was around 2,000 years ago. All emperors in between the first stone surrounded by mud and the last brick continued to build it upon his wishes.

### [**Terracotta Army**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army)
The Terracotta Army (or Terracotta Warriors and Horses) is a collection of about unique 8000 terracotta sculptures that were discovered in 1974 and later continuously dug out.

According to historian [Sima Qian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sima_Qian) (145--90 BCE) work on the Terracotta Army started soon after Emperor Qinshihuang took the throne at age 13 in 246 BCE. The whole project was created by a total of 700,000 workers and 37 years of hard work. The fact that 700,000 people could build over 8000 unique life-sized terracotta sculptures in 37 years completely blows my mind.

These Terracotta statues were constructed for the purpose of protecting the emperor in his afterlife. There have been conspiracy theories that the Terracotta Army is [fake](http://hastebin.com/raw/qopocidupa), but nonetheless it is an amazing sight to see.

### [**Famous Chinese People and Leaders**](http://hastebin.com/raw/sojuqorete)
#### Emperor Qinshihuang
Emperor Qinshihuang was the first emperor of all China. He unified China to end the Warring States period at around the age of 13. If it were not for Emperor Qinshihuang, China may have never stopped warring.

#### Confucius
Confucius was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher. He is known for saying a whole lot of smart things, inventing the Golden Rule, creating a really smart code of ethics called [Confucianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism), and being really freaking smart.

Did I mention he was smart?

#### Sima Qian
Sima Qian was a Chinese historian most famous for his history of classic China, [*Shiji*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24226/24226-0.txt). It documented a time when there wasn't very many other accounts of what was happening. Written during the [Han dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty), it is respected as a model for biographical literature with high literary value.
